# Friends of Shopware

FriendsOfShopware is a group of passionate developers who have banded together to build solid and well tested Shopware Plugins using modern coding standards.


# How do I get in touch?

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/FriendsOfShopware/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/FriendsOfShopware/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/FriendsOfShopware/Lobby)

Several of us hang out in [Shopware's gitter channel](https://gitter.im/shopware/shopware). 
We also have our [own gitter channel](https://gitter.im/FriendsOfShopware/Lobby). 
Finally if you want to ask for a vote (for example to propose a new topic/plugin) please have a look at the [contribution document](CONTRIBUTING.md).


# How can I become a member?

All maintainers of a project are automatically in the Friends of Shopware group. 
That doesn't mean that you have to provide an own plugin. 
Contributing to our existing plugins is also very important and we are always glad to find new developers for our exciting projects.

If you do want to contribute your own plugins, please be aware that we won't guarantee admission before you provide at least a functional prototype.
The important thing is that **you** are convinced by your idea and you should be developing solely for this occasion.


# Code Review Workflow

* Reviews will be taken by a frosh member, which is not in conjunction with the project
  * Open code reviews will be posted to [a special channel on gitter](https://gitter.im/FriendsOfShopware/openreviews)
  * Frosh members which have time can pick a pull request and review it
  * At least one approve must be given by a frosh member, before a pull request can be merged
* Obvious stuff can be committed without review (Example: Typo fixes)
